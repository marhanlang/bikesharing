Most bike trips are under 1 hour long and 5 minute trips are the most common.

Mon-Fri bike trips are common in the mornings and afternoon, likely due to using the bikes as a means of commuting.

Males make up the majority of users. Females make up a little over one quarter of users. When comparing the number of rides by time and gender, females users again make up a little over 1 quarter of the rides. Despite fewer female users overall, this shows the existing female users bike at around the same rate as the male users.

The majority of bike users are subscribers and subscribers show more bike use Mon-Fri. This supports the theory that bikes are being used for commuting. There may be more male subscribers utilizing the bikes for commutes due to precieved safety of bike riding alone in a city.

# Summary:
 Bikesharing appears to be most successful among male commuters. When determining success of a bikesharing service in Des Moines, one has to consider the city safety for commuters, tourism for weekend bike users, and distance of travel between popular destinations and bike stations. Most bike rides were short with the most popular ride duration being only five minutes. This can indicate that the bikes are more popular for traversing short distances than longer trips. Strategic positioning of bike stations can boost popularity of the bikes. stations should be positioned in safe areas that are relatively close to popular traveler destinations.
 
 For further analysis, it's recommended that visualizations be created to find age of users by gender in order to determine average male and female user ages. Another useful visualization would be comparing age and subscriber info to determine if there is a link between age of user and whether they are more likely to be a regular subscriber than a casual customer.
